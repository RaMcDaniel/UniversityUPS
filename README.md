# UniversityUPS
Package Delivery Service Project

University UPS is console based Python program to create truck routes for a hypothetical package delivery service. The addresses and distances between each set of address pairs is given, and fed into the program from CSV files. A nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented on each of 3 different trucks to deliver all packages on time. Various constraints on the packages are also taken into account, such as preferred truck, leaving the hub later, traveling with specific other packages, etc.
