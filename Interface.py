# C)     Phase I II â€“ Implement Command Line Interface
# a.  At a minimum, you need a command line interface that will ask the user for a specific time.
# b.  Once you have the time, display the status of all packages at that specific time as Delivered or Not Delivered.
# i. utilize the timestamp of the packages in the hash table to determine their delivered state at the particular time.
# 1. If the timestamp of the package is before the user time, the package is Delivered and vice versa.
# c.   Ensure that the package status output is a neatly formatted table listed in ascending order by package ID.
#  i.   You can loop through all package ids and use the hash table lookup() function to retrieve each package.
